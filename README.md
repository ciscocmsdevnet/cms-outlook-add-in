# Cisco Meeting Server Outlook Add-In
**Get CMS Meeting Information while scheduling Outlook meeting**

Cisco Meeting Server is an on-premies meeting server. This Add-In is created using CMS API's üëÄ, some Python üêç and some JavaScript ùí•. We have released a new version, better than our PoC version, keeping simple deployments, easy of use in mindüß† .

Feel free to provide us any feedbacks on `cmsdevelopers@cisco.com` ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Disclaimer: 

* PLEASE DO NOT SCALE TEST THIS ADD-IN WHEN YOUR CMS CLUSTER IS BUSY SERVING MEETINGS
* DO NOT DEPLOY THIS MIDDLEWARE IN DMZ, AS WE HAVE NOT EVALUATED ANY SECURITY REQUIREMENT FOR THIS SOLUTION. 
* NO CISCO TAC SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THIS ADD-IN. PLEASE REACH OUT TO `cmsdevelopers@cisco.com` IF YOU INTEND TO DEPLOY IN CERTAIN RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENT.
* DOCKER IMAGES CAN BE PROVIDED IF YOU HAVE AIRGAP NETWORK AND CANNOT CREATE IMAGES. PLEASE REACH OUT TO `cmsdevelopers@cisco.com`. THESE IMAGES WILL BE VERIFIED AGAINST DOCKER-SCAN-PLUGIN AVAILABLE FROM DOCKER HUB. THEY WILL NOT BE CISCO APPROVED DOCKER IMAGES.
* PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRY THIS ON ANY PRODUCTION SYSTEM, UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE TESTING YOURSELF (_trust your testing_)
* YOU DO NOT NEED ANY ADDITIONAL LICENSES TO MAKE THIS ADD-IN WORK WITH CMS. WE USE CMS `pmp` AND `smp` LICENSE FOR CREATING SPACES

## Solution Highlights:

> **From version 1 to version 2, we have add some flexibility and simplicity to deployments**
- This version provides:
  - Capability to get Meeting Information from existing CMS Space
  - Capability to create a new Space on-demand and get Meeting Information
  - Ability to get Instant Meeting without login into CMS Add-In
  
- A middleware application needs to be deployed which
  - Acts like a bridge between Outlook Client and your CMS Environment
  - It provides you with all logs for troubleshooting
  - It does not store any credentials
  - Stores user meeting formation in Redis Cache DB, to save un-necessary API Requests to CMS.
  
- The login session in Add-in is valid for 24 hours, as a result user may need to login every 24 hour.
- This Add-In is tested and works in air-gap environments also.


## Pre-requisites:
- An Ubuntu machine with minimum 2GB RAM, 2vCPU, 50GB hard disk. 

### Middleware Setup

- **Install docker, docker-compose and openssl**. Logout and Login after running these commands
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io openssl
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version
```

- **Internal CA Signed Certificate** (Outlook Add-In only communicates via Https, hence we need certificate to be signed by CA, which your organisation trusts)
- A **hostname** for the middleware (everybody needs a name üòù)
- Network reachability between Outlook clients to Middleware to CMS Infrastructure
  
### Add-In Support
- This Add-in is only supported on following versions of Outlook:
  - Outlook 2013 or later on Windows
  - Outlook 2016 or later on Mac
  - Outlook on the web for Exchange 2016 or later
  - Outlook on the web for Exchange 2013
  - Outlook.com

### Add-In Config Parameters
- In version 2, we have added some configs to increase the flexibility

> Modify `config.env` found in addInBackend Folder:
```env
WEB_ADMIN=<cms web admin URL>
WEB_ADMIN_USERNAME=<API username>
WEB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<API password>
WEB_BRIDGES_OPTIONS=<List of web-bridges>
INSTANT_MEETING_WEB_BRIDGE=<web-bridge hostname for instant meeting>
SPACE_TEMPLATE=<space template, to be used when creating instant meeting>
CALL_ID_PREFIX=<call-id prefix for space created for instant meeting>
JID_ATTRIBUTE=<if outlook domain is different than CMS domain>
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=<middleware hostname>
PROVISIONED_COSPACES=<True, if user have provionsioned co-spaces>
INVITATION_LANG=<Language support for invitation>
```
> Sample `config.env` for reference (backend):
```env
WEB_ADMIN=https://abc.cisco.com
WEB_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
WEB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
WEB_BRIDGES_OPTIONS=["web.cisco.com","10.48.90.99"]
INSTANT_MEETING_WEB_BRIDGE=web.cisco.com
SPACE_TEMPLATE=Provisioned Team Space
CALL_ID_PREFIX=423423
JID_ATTRIBUTE=None
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=middleware.cisco.com
PROVISIONED_COSPACES=0
INVITATION_LANG=en_GB
```

> Modify `config.env` found in addInFrontend Folder:
```
BACKEND_URL=https://<middleware hostname>/addin/v1
```
> Sample `config.env` for reference(frontend):
```
BACKEND_URL=https://middleware.cisco.com/addin/v1
```

#### CMS Readiness

- In order to use this Add-In effectively, make sure you have
  - coSpace Template created on your CMS
  - CallLegProfiles assigned to you coSpace Template
  - User provisioned coSpaces when using web app for users

## Deployment Steps [Online]

### Stage 1: Generate Certificates

1. Get a hostname for your middleware service, eg: middleware.cisco.com
2. Add DNS entry for this hostname in your DNS server OR your system's  `/etc/host` file
3. Login to your linux machine and follow below steps:
   1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ciscocmsdevnet/cms-outlook-add-in.git`
   2. Create a folder `certs` in this git repo: `mkdir certs`
   3. Generate certificate in this `certs` folder:
      1. Generate a CSR: `sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certificate.key -out certificate.csr`
      2. Specify necessary details required for the certificate (Country, State, hostname etc). Below snippet is just for reference [Snapshot 1]
      3. You would get key file and csr file in this `certs` folder: `certificate.key` and `certificate.csr`
      4. Get the CSR signed by you internal CA and copy it under same folder. 

**Note**: Make sure CA signed certificate ends with .cer extension. If incase you receive .crt certificate from your CA, refer this link on how to convert [(How can I convert a certificate file from .crt to .cer? | SonicWall)](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/how-can-i-convert-a-certificate-file-from-crt-to-cer/170504597576961/)

### Stage 2: Deploy Middleware

**You need to create docker images from the code base directly**. B
1. Login to same linux server and go to repository folder
2. Issue command: `docker-compose build`. This command will create new docker images
3. Modify `config.env` in addInBackend folder. Refer [Add-In Config Parameters](#add-in-config-parameters) section
4. Modify `config.env` in addInFrontend folder. Refer [Add-In Config Parameters](#add-in-config-parameters) section
5. Lets run the service:
   1. `docker-compose up -d`
   2. Make sure all containers are up by : `docker-compose ps`

### Stage 3: Modify Outlook Manifest files
	
1. Update manifest file with your middleware hostname. In the repository refer `manifest_reference.xml`. Replace `[Hostname]` with your middleware hostname


### Stage 4: Add Add-In to Outlook Clients
	
1. Add this Add-in using this manifest file in your outlook client. Refer this link on how to add Add-in through file.(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing?tabs=windows)


## Deployment Steps [Offline]

- For deployments with no internet access to create images, follow below steps:

1. Reach out to `cmsdevelopers@cisco.com` to get access to docker images. A Cisco box link will be created for you to download images
2. Load the images: `docker load --input cmsschedular.tar`
3. create a file `backend-config.env` and copy backend mentioned in [Add-In Config Parameters](#add-in-config-parameters). Please use values relevant to your environment
4. create file `frontend-config.env` and copy frontend configs mentioned [Add-In Config Parameters](#add-in-config-parameters).Please use values relevant to your environment
5. Follow [Stage 1: Generate Certificates](#stage-1-generate-certificates) steps
6. Lets run the service:
   1. `docker-compose up -d`
   2. Make sure all containers are up by : `docker-compose ps`
